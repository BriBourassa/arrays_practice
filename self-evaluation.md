1. How confident do you feel?
* Not very. I understand all of the individual concepts but when it comes to putting them together and getting anything to work I am really stuck.

2. Is there any additional learning you need or want?
* Yes, I don't really know what I'm doing. I feel like I missed a step on how to get anything to *happen*. How do I "call" anything? What does that mean?

3. What questions do you have about arrays?
* I don't even know what to ask at this point. console.log doesn't do anything in Terminal, which is what it looks like is the command but I have no idea. The instructions are vague and I don't know where the disconnect is in my brain.
